# The Daily Show with Jon Stewart Episode Downloader

A simple script to download and combine the clips into a full episode of the Daily Show with Jon Stewart. Works for other shows such as the Colbert Report as well. This script was made because viewing these episodes through Comedy Central's online player is not a pleasant experience.

I made this script for my own personal use, and is it not particularly well made. It just works well enough for my purposes with minimal coding effort on my part. There are many ways it could break, and it certainly will when Comedy Central updates their UI.

Only tested on MacOS, but I am confident it will work on most Unix OSes. It might work on Windows.

Requires Python 3, all the pip packages used, FFMPEG, and the Chrome driver for Selenium.
