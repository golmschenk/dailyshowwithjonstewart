# The Daily Show with Jon Stewart Episode Downloader

_NOTE: The layout of the archived pages has been changed and this script does not currently work._

A simple script to download and combine the clips of the Daily Show with Jon Stewart into a full episode. Works for other shows such as the Colbert Report as well. This script was made because viewing these episodes through Comedy Central's online player is not a pleasant experience.

Running the download script will download the next episode in the unwatched episodes list file. Another function in the download script will download all episodes (though this would take a very long time to do).

I made this script for my own personal use, and is it not particularly well made. It just works well enough for my purposes with minimal coding effort on my part. There are many ways it could break, and it certainly will when Comedy Central updates their UI.

Only tested on MacOS, but I am confident it will work on most Unix OSes. It might work on Windows.

Requires Python 3, pip packages listed in requirements.txt, FFmpeg, and the Chrome driver for Selenium.
